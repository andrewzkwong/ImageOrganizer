# ImageOrganizer

ImageOrganizer is a JavaFX based desktop application that allows you to quickly sort your image files into folders 
with the press of a button rather than with unwieldy drag-and-drop actions. Here's how to use it:

1. Choose a source folder that has the images you want to sort by going to File->Select Source Folder. 

2. Bind destination folders to keys by going to File->Add Destination Folder.

3. As images come up, sort them to your destination folders by pressing the keys that were bound to them.

The runnable .jar is included in the repository, and a Windows executable program is included in the RELEASES folder.
